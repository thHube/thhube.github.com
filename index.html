					<h1>Work experience</h1>

					<h3>Freelance Software Engineer - <a href="http://valis.io/">Valis.io</a> </h3>
					<p>
						<i>From January 2015 to Present </i></br>
						I am working as a freelancer for several companies such as Adidas and 3D Excite developing plugins and
						automation for industrial designers for applications such as Rhinoceros 3D, MODO, Deltagen and
						Illustrator among the others. I use extensively Python, C++ and C# as the SDK and development toolkits
						of these applications allow the usage of such lanaguages. We are trying to build up a better infrastructure
						for software development for product engineering. We want to bring the best software to product
						engineers and industrial designers and bend it to their needs. We develop plugins and automation
						that allows designers and product managers to interact better and deliver faster. Our aim is to
						remove the obstacles that step in your way when developing a product.
					</p>

					<h3>Software Engineer - <a href="http://www.3dexcite.com">Dassault Systemes 3D EXCITE (formerly RealTime Technology AG)</a></h3>
					<p>
						<i>From December 2012 to January 2015</i></br>
						Deltagen is a professional high-end 3D visualization platform. It allows to create and deploy persuasive
						3D visuals. The application offers a powerful plug-in mechanism to adapt it to customer's use cases.
						As a member of team core, our resposibility are to extend and maintain system-level features such
						as scene graph and material management, distributed rendering, metadata handling and plugin infrastructure.
						My duties ranges from the development of new modules to maintainance of legacy code and bug fixing.
						I am, together with Deltagen Architect in charge of the SDK that allows customers or RTT developers
						to extend the application's functionality through plugins that could be written in C++, Python
						and ActionScript.
						<br/> At RTT I learned the importance of team work and quality assurance in a large product used by
						customers with high expectations such as the automotive firms are. Begin such a big product built
						out of several millions of lines of C++ code, I learned the discipline of diving in a large codebase
						built across more than a decade and the importance of the communication between developers.
					</p>

					<h3>Freelance Software Consultant - <a href="http://www.metaverso.info/">Metaverso</a></h3>
					<p>
						<i>From September 2010 to October 2012.</i></br>
						I helped Metaverso developing various projects for their customers and for internal use. As Metaverso
						is not a software company they needed someone that filled thier software needs when a customer
						asked them to design an innovative marketing solution. Here I used C++, C#, Adobe Actionscript,
						Lua for the creation of real-time 2D/3D interactive desktop, web and mobile applications. The projects
						included the creation of augmented reality and Unity3D prototypes, kinect data acquisition tools
						and various interactive exhibit for firms and museums. This was the first time where I had to manage
						projects on my own, in an industrial environment. I was able to learn how important is clear communication
						with the customer and co-workers that does not understand anything about software development.
					</p>

					<h3>Intern/Software Engineer - Alestea srl</h3>
					<p>
						<i>From April 2010 to Septemper 2010.</i>
						<br/> Internship for my Bachelor graduation. Development of CAE software with FEM processing in C/C++
						and CUDA. My Bachelor thesis has focused on the development of a solver for linear symmetric sparse
						matrices. This solver has been developed using Nvidia CUDA technology.
					</p>

					<h3>Intern/Programmer - Alestea srl</h3>
					<p>
						<i>From June 2009 to October 2009.</i>
						<br/> Internship. Development of a Spline module in C/C++ for internal use in CAE applications. Use
						of Microsoft Foundation Class library together with an internally developed CAE module for FEM
						and computer-aided drawing for software creation.
					</p>

					<h3>Intern/Programmer - WebTinTin snc</h3>
					<p>
						<i>From June 2008 to October 2009. </i>
						<br/> This was my first work experience as a software developer, at Web TinTin I developed various web
						components in Adobe Actionscript, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS for customers operating
						mainly in the sport system. There I learned how to start a project from scratch and how to read
						and understand code written by other people.

					<h1>Education</h1>

					<h3>M.Sc, Computer Science - University of Padua</h3>
					<p>
						<i>From October 2010 to October 2012</i>
						<br/> Graduated summa cum laude (110 with honors over 110). Thesis Title: <i>True concurrency and atomicity: a
						model-checking approach with contextual Petri nets</i>. My master degree focused on the study of
						the theoretical basis of computer science. This choice was driven by a personal need for deeper
						understanding of what is under the hood rather than acquiring practical skills as I did in the
						bachelor degree.
					</p>

					<h3>B.Sc, Computer Science - University of Padua</h3>
					<p>
						<i>From October 2007 to July 2010</i>
						<br/> Graduated 100 over 110. Thesis Title: <i>Solution strategies for linear sparse matrices with GPGPU
						and multi-core technologies</i>. Thesis project consisted in the creation of a sparse linear solver
						with CUDA and C++ to use in FEM applications. I decided to attend computer science after quitting
						physics to further my passions for computer graphics and programming languages.
					</p>

					<h3>B.Sc, Physics - University of Padua</h3>
					<p>
						<i>From October 2006 to September 2007</i>
						<br/> I quit the course after the first year, having passed four exams out of eight. I decided to quit
						the course due to a greater interest in computer science rather then in physics. It was a hard
						choice but, probably, the best of my life. The year I spent studing there taught me a lot about
						dedication, discipline and math.
