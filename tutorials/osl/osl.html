<h1>OPEN SHADING LANGUAGE</h1>
<p>
I have recently come to know the 
<a href="https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage">Open Shading Language</a> project by 
<a href="http://opensource.imageworks.com/">Sony ImageWorks</a>. For those, like me, that are 
enthused by computer graphics it is a great possibility to taste a professional shading language 
without the need to buy expensive software such as Pixar's RenderMan. The Open Shading Language 
(OSL from now on for sake of brevity) is a open-source implementation of a shading language for 
photorealistic image production. It is currently in use at ImageWorks and it has been used for 
many of their award-winning production. It sounds a little bit cheesy but truly, if you ever 
experienced shader programming at any level you will love it. As the development of the Open Shading
Language is ongoing, by the time you read this article the informations contained here may not be 
valid anymore. Please refer to the latest documentation in order to port the shaders contained here
to newer language versions.
</p> 

<h2>The Language</h2>
<p>
Designers of OSL has, IMHO, as their main source of inspiration the RenderMan shading language. Begin
probably the first (this is for sure, it is the first shading language at all) and most used shading 
language for off-line production, OSL takes lot of inspiration from Pixar's counterpart. We find 
four different types of shaders (text in italic is extracted from the OSL specification):
</p>
<img class="right-img" src="img/fst.png" />
<ul>
    <li>
        <code><b>surface</b></code> shaders. <i>Surface shaders determine the basic material properties 
        of a surface and how it reacts to light.</i> They are responsible for computing the color 
        (a color closure, we will see this in detail) of the material. If you have experience with 
        RenderMan you know what I am talking about, if you come from a GLSL or HLSL background these
        type of shaders are something to fragment/pixel shader programs in those frameworks. These 
        programs calculate the reaction of a surface to a given light stimuli. 
    </li>

    <li>
        <code><b>displacement</b></code> shaders. <i>Displacement shaders alter the position and 
        shading normal (or, optionally, just the shading normal) to make a piece of geometry appear 
        deformed, wrinkled, or bumpy.</i> So far so good, the OSL specification explanation is pretty
        self-explanatory. In common GPU programming these are called vertex shaders and has exactly 
        the same purpose (more or less). These are the only shader that can manipulate the geometry
        and this is exactly their purpose, if you want to implement bump mapping this is the shader 
        type you want to use. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <code><b>volume</b></code> shaders. <i>Volume shaders describe how a participating medium 
        (air, smoke, glass, etc.) reacts to light and affects the appearance of objects on the other 
        side of the medium.</i> Also this is quite self-explanatory. The volume shader describe the 
        behavior of light across the particular geometry that delimits itself. The concept is 
        similar to surface shaders except that the shader may be called from a point inside the 
        volume and not only on the geometric primitives.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code><b>shader</b></code> shaders. <i>Generic shaders are used for utility code, generic 
        routines that may be called as individual layers in a shader group.</i> The most general 
        version, these kind of programs can be used for any type of computation (but cannot modify 
        the geometry) and can have whatsoever output values. The extract from the documentation 
        introduce an important concept: <i>shader groups</i>. We will discuss this later on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Those of you that eat RenderMan and cornflakes in the morning (allow me to use this Italian colloquial
metaphor) will immediately notice that there are a few difference from the RenderMan language. Light 
shader are missing from this list (although they are listed in the official documentation), probably
these particular kind of programs are not yet supported by the language. We will not discuss about 
those until some documentation will pop up somewhere. 
</p>

<p>
If you are comfortable with C and you have no problem with other similar frameworks you will learn 
OSL in a flash. Its syntax is heavily inspired by the aforementioned language and its shading dialects.
Each compilation unit can contains one and only one shader. The compiler will give you an error 
if you define multiple shaders per file. Files usually ends with <code>.osl</code> extensions. Here
we define a simple shader extracted from the Blender Cycles documentation:
</p>
<div class="osl">
<code>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdosl.h&gt;

shader SimpleMaterial(
    color diffuse_color = color(0.6, 0.8, 0.6),
    float noise_factor = 0.5,
    output closure color bsdf = diffuse(N))
{
   color material_color = diffuse_color * mix(1.0, noise(P * 10.0), noise_factor);
   bsdf = material_color * diffuse(N);
}
</pre>
</code>
</div>
<p>
Lot of stuff in this simple example. Here you can understand the basic shader syntax, it resembles a
function declaration in C/C++ with some special adding. The <code>shader</code> keyword tells the 
compiler that the compilation unit defines a generic shader, that may be substituted by <code>surface</code>,
<code>volume</code> or <code>displacement</code> according to your needs. The parameter list has default 
values for each shader parameter. You must define a default value for each parameter and those are 
treated as constants, only output parameters may be assigned. The <code>output</code> parameter 
defines what the shader computes. In our simple example we want to calculate a color so we provide 
a <code>closure color</code> as output parameter. 
</p>

<p>
The concept of closures may not be familiar to everyone, hence it is important to spend a few words 
on it. <i>A closure is an expression or a function call that will be stored along with necessary 
contextual information, to be evaluated at a later time.</i> This means that the evaluation of 
<code>bsdf</code> in our example shader could be done in a different time frame w.r.t. the execution
of the shader. This concept remains unclear here but it is clearer used with functions, if you are 
familiar with C++ 11 a similar concept there are lambdas. A closure is a generic holder for any type
(data or functions) that can be evaluated later that its creation so it needs to store all its 
context, if I managed to confuse you enough then it means that you are on the way to understand 
this concept. Wikipedia has a really good explanation. In OSL (I think, not sure about this) is to
optimize shader calculation using lazy evaluation of closures trying to delay later in the time the 
evaluation of a shader. 
</p>

<p>
Another important thing to understand is how shader collaborate one with each other. If you have a 
<img class="img-left" src="img/blnd_node_net.png" />   
GLSL background (as I did before diving into OSL) you may find disturbing the lack of a defined 
pipeline that connect the execution and the data flow across shaders. Indeed, once you understand that 
OSL shaders collaborate through a user defined pipeline you will be amazed how flexible this mechanism
is. In your renderer (Cycles in my case) you can specify your own pipeline and how data is streamed 
across your kernels. When you create a <i>script</i> node Blender allow you to choose its source, 
tries to compile it with OSL compiler and, if successful, displays the input and output parameters
as in the figure on the right. You can use other shaders to generate input parameters or use bundled 
nodes. The OSL specification let to each single renderer implementation the freedom to choose which
mechanism to use to enable collaboration between shaders. Each OSL script defines a node in blender
material network that can be connected to obtain the desired result in your final render. A nice 
feature of Cycles is that it gives you an interactive render window that allow you to see the result 
of your changes in quasi-real-time. 

</p>

<h2>Setting up a test environment</h2>
<p>
You may want to setup your own test environment now, to test the power and the beauty of OSL. Here 
is a quick guide on how to get ready to write some cool shaders with Blender and Cycles. Please notice
that OSL is supported since Blender 2.65 so you have to pick that or a new version of 
<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. I am using version 2.69 for this tutorial.
</p>
<img class="right-img" src="img/render_select.png">

<ul>
    <li>
        You need to first select Cycles render from the upper right drop-down menu. The default value is 
        <i>Blender Render</i>, you must change this. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In the render property tab you must activate OSL support. This will force the rendering to 
        happen in the CPU instead of using GPU acceleration, we hope that in the future this will 
        change. You are now ready to create your first shader. The default cube is good enough to start. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the internal text editor, you can also use external data field but for the first example 
        I would simply use the internal editor. There you can copy the script above, save your file. 
    </li>
        Go to the <i>material tab</i> there you need to specify that you will use nodes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to the <i>node editor</i> and remove the default <i>Diffuse BSDF</i> node. Add a script 
        node and use the script you just pasted, if it is not immediately updated then you need to 
        hit the refresh button. If you have compilation errors you will get an error message and you 
        will see them in the console (<i>Window &raquo; Toggle System Console</i>). 
    </li>
    <li>
        Once your script is correctly compiled the node input and output will change, in our example 
        you may want to connect our <code>bsdf</code> output to <i>Surface</i> input in your 
        <i>Material Output</i> node. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The last step is to switch the viewport from <i>Solid</i> mode to <i>Render</i>. There you 
        will see your result in an interactive render window that will update every time you change
        a parameter. 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
You can play around with shaders and see what happens in real-time in the interactive rendering 
window. This is a very fast way to develop great materials. You can tweak rendering options for 
both preview and final render in the render tab in the properties. As you may want to create your 
own library I suggest you to play with Blender internal text editor (that does also a good job with
OSL syntax highlight) and then create your shaders in an external text editor.

<h2>A full example: Cornell box</h2>
<p>
To conclude this short tutorial about the Open Shading Language I would like to show a full example 
with a couple of shaders. My test scene is a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box">Cornell box</a> with some custom meshes each with
its material written in OSL. The result rendered image is shown below. We have shaders for each mesh
and a shader that generate the colors for the box. 
</p>
<img src="img/full.png" class="center-full">
<p>
Below are listed the various shaders used for generating this image. The lamp is a mesh with an 
emissive material. You find the <code>.blend</code> file attach at the bottom of the page. 
</p>

<div class="osl">
<code>
<pre>
// -- Cornell.osl - Generate the Cornell box material ---------------
#include "stdosl.h"

#define POS_Y normal(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
#define NEG_Y normal(0.0, -1.0, 0.0)
#define EPSILON 1e-5

surface Cornell(output closure color bsdf = 0)
{
    color result = color(0, 1, 0);
    
    if (dot(N, POS_Y) &lt; EPSILON) {
        result = color(1, 0, 0);
    }
    
    if (fabs(dot(N, NEG_Y)) &lt; EPSILON) {
        result = color(1, 1, 1);
    }
    bsdf = result * diffuse(N);
}

// -- Glass.osl - Generate the glass material on Suzanne ------------

float FresnelDielectric(vector i, normal n, float eta)
{
    float c = fabs(dot(i, n));
    float g = eta * eta - 1 + c * c;
    float result = 1.0;
    
    if (g > 0) {
        g = sqrt(g);
        float a = (g - c) / (g + c);
        float b = (c * (g + c) - 1) / (c * (g + c) + 1);
        result = 0.5 * a * a * (1 + b * b);
    }
    
    return result;
}

surface Glass(
    color diffuse_col = 0.8, 
    float ior = 1.45, 
    output closure color bsdf = 0)
{
    float real_ior = max(ior, IOR_THRESHOLD);
    float eta = backfacing()? 1.0 / real_ior : real_ior;
    float fr = FresnelDielectric(I, N, eta);
    
    bsdf = diffuse_col * (fr * reflection(N) + (1.0 - fr) * refraction(N, eta));
}

// -- Metal.osl - Generate the metal reflection ---------------------
#include "stdosl.h"

surface Metal(
    color diffuse_col = 0.8,
    float roughness = 1.5,
    output closure color bsdf = 0) 
{
    bsdf = diffuse_col * reflection(N);
}

// -- Velvet.osl - Generate the velvet surface ----------------------
#include "stdosl.h"

surface Metal(
    color diffuse_col = 0.8,
    float roughness = 1.5,
    output closure color bsdf = 0) 
{
